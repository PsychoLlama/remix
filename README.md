# Remix

This is a horrible programming language developed for fun. It's incredibly basic. The language is inspired by Nix. The unusual aspect is it supports both lexically and dynamically scoped variables. Lexical variables look normal, dynamically scoped variables are prefixed with an `@` sign.

See [the examples directory](./examples) for examples.

Half the reason for building this was an excuse to write [a treesitter grammar](https://github.com/PsychoLlama/tree-sitter-remix) and try compiling it into Neovim.

## Status

I'm no longer working on it. I built it a long time ago. This is published to keep me humble.
